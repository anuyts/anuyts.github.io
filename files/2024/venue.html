<h2>Getting to Leuven</h2>

<h3>By train</h3>
<strong>NMBS train planners:</strong> <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en">domestic trains</a> - <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN">international train connections</a>. <br/>
In practice <a href="https://int.bahn.de/en">Deutsche Bahn</a> may be best aware of train connections anywhere in Europe (without necessarily being able to book them).

<strong>Leuven/Louvain</strong> railway station has direct connections to:
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Brussels-Airport Zaventem</strong> (not to be confused with Zaventem proper), a railway station directly underneath Belgium's main airport,
  <li> <strong>Brussels-South/Brussel-Zuid/Bruxelles-Midi</strong>, with direct high-speed connections to London (<a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/MGS/">MGS 2024 in Leicester</a>), Paris (incl. airport) and various destinations in France,
  <li> <strong>Luik/Liège-Guillemins</strong>, with direct high-speed connections to Frankfurt am Main (incl. airport) and Dortmund via Köln/Cologne; 3x/week a night train to Vienna; and direct IC connections to Luxembourg (<a href="https://etaps.org/2024/">ETAPS 2024</a>),
  <li> <strong>Antwerp-Central/Antwerpen-Centraal/Anvers-Central</strong>, with direct IC and high-speed connections to Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Schiphol Airport; and 3x/week a night train to Berlin.
</ul>
<strong>Note:</strong> Belgium is a multilingual country; railway announcements are made in the language of wherever you are (this even holds within a moving train!), and place names are translated. Note that the French name of Leuven is Louvain, but <strong>Louvain-la-Neuve is an entirely different place</strong>.

<h3>By car</h3>
Just drive to Leuven. Note that Belgium has severe traffic congestions, especially towards Brussels and Antwerp in the morning and in opposite direction in the evening.<br/>
<strong>Parking: TODO</strong><br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> Belgium is a multilingual country; road signs are in the language of wherever you are, and place names are translated. Note that the French name of Leuven is Louvain, but <strong>Louvain-la-Neuve is an entirely different place</strong>.

<h3>By plane</h3>
Some nearby airports that are easily reachable by train are Brussels-Airport (BRU), Paris Charles-de-Gaulle (CDG), Frankfurt am Main (FRA), Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (AMS).<br/>
Note that Brussels-South Charleroi Airport (CRL) is not at all in Brussels and does not have a railway station.
