<h2>Belgium</h2>
<p>Belgium is an EU and Schengen country, and the currency is the euro (EUR/&euro;).</p>
<p>The national languages are Dutch, French and German. Leuven is officially a monolingually Dutch-speaking city. Most Belgians have a fairly good command of the English language.</p>

<h2>Getting to Leuven</h2>

<h3>By train</h3>
<p><strong>NMBS train planners:</strong> <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en">domestic trains</a> - <a href="https://www.b-europe.com/EN">international train connections</a>. <br/>
In practice <a href="https://int.bahn.de/en">Deutsche Bahn</a> may be best aware of train connections anywhere in Europe (without necessarily being able to book them).</p>

<p><strong>Leuven/Louvain</strong> railway station has direct connections to:
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Brussels-Airport Zaventem</strong> (not to be confused with Zaventem proper), a railway station directly underneath Belgium's main airport,
  <li> <strong>Brussels-South/Brussel-Zuid/Bruxelles-Midi</strong>, with direct high-speed connections to London (<a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/MGS/">MGS 2024 in Leicester</a>), Paris (incl. airport) and various destinations in France,
  <li> <strong>Luik/Liège-Guillemins</strong>, with direct high-speed connections to Frankfurt am Main (incl. airport) and Dortmund via Köln/Cologne; 3x/week a night train to Vienna; and direct IC connections to Luxembourg (<a href="https://etaps.org/2024/">ETAPS 2024</a>),
  <li> <strong>Antwerp-Central/Antwerpen-Centraal/Anvers-Central</strong>, with direct IC and high-speed connections to Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Schiphol Airport; and 3x/week a night train to Berlin.
</ul>
<strong>Note:</strong> Railway announcements are made in the language of wherever you are (this even holds within a moving train!), and place names are translated. Note that the French name for Leuven is Louvain, but <strong>Louvain-la-Neuve is an entirely different place</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Heverlee</strong> railway station is not very well connected and is not that much closer to the campus.</p>

<h3>By car</h3>
Just drive to Leuven. Note that Belgium has severe traffic congestions, especially towards Brussels and Antwerp in the morning and in opposite direction in the evening.<br/>
<strong>Parking: TODO</strong><br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> Road signs are in the language of wherever you are, and place names are translated. Note that the French name for Leuven is Louvain, but <strong>Louvain-la-Neuve is an entirely different place</strong>.

<h3>By plane</h3>
Some nearby airports that are easily reachable by train are <strong>Brussels-Airport (BRU)</strong>, Paris Charles-de-Gaulle (CDG), Frankfurt am Main (FRA), Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (AMS).<br/>
Note that Brussels-South Charleroi Airport (CRL) is <strong>not</strong> at all in Brussels and does <strong>not</strong> have a railway station.

<h2>Local transport in Leuven</h2>
<h3>Bike</h3>
By far the easiest mode of local transport in Leuven is the bike, especially since the Arenberg science campuses are located outside of the city center.
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://www.velo.be/nl/fietspunt-leuven-station">Velo</a> bike rental near the railway station. (Don't click "Fietsverhuur" (bike rental) but just scroll down for the short-term tariffs.)
  <li> <a href="https://www.blue-bike.be/en/">Blue-bike</a>: shared bikes to pick up at Leuven/Heverlee railway station and drop off at the <strong>same</strong> location. Cheap yearly subscription + low price per fare. (Not yet sure what's the best way to subscribe if you live abroad.)
</ul>

<h3>Walk</h3>
You'll rarely have to walk more than a few kilometers, so it's a serious option if you like walking.

<h3>Bus</h3>
Public buses in Flanders are served by <a href="https://www.delijn.be/en/">De Lijn</a>.<br/>
Relevant bus stops are Heverlee <strong>Celestijnenlaan</strong> and Heverlee <strong>Campus Arenberg</strong>.<br/>
The city center's bus hub is <strong>Rector De Somerplein</strong> (which is spread over Rector De Somerplein, Margarethaplein and Grote Markt).
<ul>
  <li> Bus 2 "Heverlee Campus" frequently drives from Leuven railway station to Heverlee Celestijnenlaan &amp; Campus Arenberg (terminus). It takes a big detour.
  <li> Bus 2 "Kessel-Lo Hulsberg" goes back.
  <li> Bus 616 is a faster but less frequent connection between Leuven railway station, Heverlee Celestijnenlaan (not Campus Arenberg!) and Brussels Airport (but take a big margin if you're going to take the bus to your plane).
</ul>
